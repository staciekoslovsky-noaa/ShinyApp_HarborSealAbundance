# Coastal Harbor Seal Abundance: Shiny App

This repository stores the code and required data for running the Shiny app that was developed for representing harbor seal abundance estimates visually and interactively. This work was done collaboratively with a UW CICOES intern (Allison James).

The code and files within this repository are detailed as follows:
* **Data folder** - contains the data required for running the application
* **LegacyCode folder** - contains older code that was used to develop an earlier iteration of the application
* **HarborSealAbundance_Functions.R** - code containing functions used both during data prep and for powering the Shiny app
* **HarborSealAbundance_PrepData4App.R** - code for preparing data for use in the Shiny app
* **ShinyApp_HarborSealAbundance.R** - code for running the Shiny app
* **ShinyApp_HarborSealAbundance_4EDMW.R** version was presented at the NOAA Environmental Data Management Workshop in 2022
